Patients with schizophrenia often show verbal learning deficits that have been linked
to the pathophysiology of the disorder and result in functional impairment. This study
examined the biological basis of these deficits by comparing the brain response of
patients with schizophrenia (n=17) to that of healthy comparison participants (n=14)
during a verbal paired-associates learning task using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). Brain response during new word learning was examined within and between
groups in two a priori regions of interest, the inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus,
and across the whole brain. In regions of group difference, we also examined the relationship
of brain response during learning to later recall of the word pairs. Despite successful
matching of levels of word-pair recall, patients' brain response during new learning
was abnormal in bilateral regions within the inferior frontal gyrus, a small region
in left posterior hippocampus, and other areas within the frontal, parietal and temporal
cortex compared with healthy individuals. In some regions, but not in the hippocampus,
patients with the most normal brain response also remembered the most word pairs following
scanning. Thus, verbal learning deficits found among patients with schizophrenia appear
to be related to hypofunction of distributed brain networks.
