Memory deficits are common in schizophrenia. Recent studies have demonstrated that
relational memory is particularly impaired.To study the neural correlates of relational
memory in schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging.Cross-sectional
case-control study.Academic medical center. Subjects Twenty patients with schizophrenia
and 17 control subjects.Behavioral performance and brain activity were assessed during
the discrimination of previously seen and novel pairs of visual stimuli, which varied
in the degree of relational memory load. We performed whole-brain and region-of-interest
(hippocampus) analyses.Schizophrenic subjects displayed normal activation of the presupplementary
motor area and ventral prefrontal cortex, but significantly decreased recruitment
of the right parietal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex when discriminating novel
pairs derived from a sequence of stimuli. Discrimination accuracy was decreased in
schizophrenia only when the flexible representation of a sequence was required. This
selective deficit was associated with decreased activation of the right parietal cortex
and left hippocampus.Schizophrenia is characterized by a specific deficit of relational
memory, which is associated with impaired function of the parietal cortex and hippocampus.
Abnormal relational memory may be at the core of 2 prominent features of schizophrenia,
ie, cognitive deficits and psychosis.
