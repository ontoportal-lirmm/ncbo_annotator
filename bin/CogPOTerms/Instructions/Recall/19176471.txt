We recently showed that, in healthy individuals, emotional expression influences memory
for faces both in terms of accuracy and, critically, in memory response bias (tendency
to classify stimuli as previously seen or not, regardless of whether this was the
case). Although schizophrenia has been shown to be associated with deficit in episodic
memory and emotional processing, the relation between these processes in this population
remains unclear. Here, we used our previously validated paradigm to directly investigate
the modulation of emotion on memory recognition. Twenty patients with schizophrenia
and matched healthy controls completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
study of recognition memory of happy, sad, and neutral faces. Brain activity associated
with the response bias was obtained by correlating this measure with the contrast
subjective old (ie, hits and false alarms) minus subjective new (misses and correct
rejections) for sad and happy expressions. Although patients exhibited an overall
lower memory performance than controls, they showed the same effects of emotion on
memory, both in terms of accuracy and bias. For sad faces, the similar behavioral
pattern between groups was mirrored by a largely overlapping neural network, mostly
involved in familiarity-based judgments (eg, parahippocampal gyrus). In contrast,
controls activated a much larger set of regions for happy faces, including areas thought
to underlie recollection-based memory retrieval (eg, superior frontal gyrus and hippocampus)
and in novelty detection (eg, amygdala). This study demonstrates that, despite an
overall lower memory accuracy, emotional memory is intact in schizophrenia, although
emotion-specific differences in brain activation exist, possibly reflecting different
strategies.
