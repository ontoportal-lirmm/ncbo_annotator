Memory is one of the cognitive functions most affected in schizophrenia, with deficits
observed from the first episode of psychosis (FEP). Previous studies have indicated
that some memory processes may be more affected than others.To examine the neural
correlates of 3 specific memory processes in FEP by means of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI).Case-control study.Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychoses
of the Douglas Hospital and Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. Subjects
Twenty-six patients with FEP and 20 healthy controls.Behavioral performance and regional
brain activity measured during memory encoding by fMRI. Our fMRI design included 3
within-subject contrasts (associative vs item-oriented encoding, encoding of arbitrary
vs semantically related image pairs, and successful vs unsuccessful memory encoding)
that were then used for group conjunctions and between-group analyses.Patients with
FEP showed normal activation of several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex,
hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortex, during successful memory encoding and associative
encoding. In contrast, the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal areas showed
reduced activity during the encoding of arbitrary pairs. This selective dysfunction
reflected by abnormal brain activation during encoding was accompanied by a greater
deficit for subsequent recognition of arbitrary pairs relative to the semantically
related pairs.This study demonstrated that, in the same group of patients with FEP,
the hippocampus could show either normal or abnormal modulation of activation depending
on the specific cognitive process that was examined. The normal modulation of hippocampal
activation observed during successful memory encoding in FEP argues against a general
inability to recruit this region. Instead, the dysfunction was specifically linked
to semantic relatedness. This selective deficit seems to affect memory performance
in FEP and denotes an important representational problem that may confer greater vulnerability
to psychotic disorders and would thus be interesting to examine in high-risk populations.
