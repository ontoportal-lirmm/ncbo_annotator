Affective facial processing is an important component of interpersonal relationships.
The neural substrate has been examined following treatment with antidepressant medication
but not with psychological therapies. The present study investigated the neural correlates
of implicit processing of sad facial expressions in depression pretreatment and posttreatment
with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).The patient group consisted of 16 medication-free
subjects (mean age 40 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of acute unipolar major depression,
and the comparison group were 16 matched healthy volunteers. Subjects participated
in a prospective study with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at weeks
0 and 16. During the fMRI scans, subjects performed an affect recognition task with
facial stimuli morphed to display varying intensities of sadness. Patients received
16 sessions of CBT. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed for the
mean activation and differential response to variable intensity (load-response) of
facial affect processing.During an acute depressive episode, patients showed elevated
amygdala-hippocampal activity relative to healthy individuals. Baseline dorsal anterior
cingulate activity in patients showed a significant relationship with subsequent clinical
response.These data provide further support for elevated amygdala activity in depression
and suggest that anterior cingulate activity may be a predictor of treatment response
to both pharmacotherapy and CBT.
