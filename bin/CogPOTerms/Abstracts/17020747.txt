Patients with schizophrenia have difficulty using contextual information to recall
the source of information. Given the importance of the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex (PFC) in this type of memory, we hypothesized that this cognitive deficit stemmed
from aberrant fronto-hippocampal activation during memory retrieval.Patients with
schizophrenia (n = 16) and age-matched comparison subjects (n = 16) underwent functional
magnetic resonance imaging while performing a verbal memory task that requires intact
use of temporal context. Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal during correct
memory decisions was compared between the two groups with statistical parametric mapping.Contrary
to our hypotheses, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated nearly identical memory
performance to that of the comparison subjects. Despite this, there were significant
between-group BOLD signal differences, including a pattern of task-dependent hypofrontality
or hyperfrontality. In addition, whereas the highest-performing subset of the comparison
group demonstrated robust modulation of hippocampal activity, this pattern was not
seen in the highest-performing patients with schizophrenia.Despite memory performance
similar to that of comparison subjects, patients with schizophrenia activated different
neural pathways to achieve this success. This might reflect underlying neuropathology
in fronto-hippocampal circuitry, the use of an alternate cognitive strategy to accomplish
task performance, or both.
