Bipolar disorder is regarded as a disorder of mood and initial studies have focused
on structural abnormalities in limbic networks, known to subserve mood. More recently,
functional imaging studies allude to affect processing deficits, which may involve
frontostriatal networks. This study sought to explore disturbances in networks involved
in the processing of negative affect in euthymic bipolar patients. We used simultaneous
functional magnetic resonance imaging and galvanic skin responsivity to explore disturbances
in these networks. When processing negative affect, controls recruited a distributed
subcortical-prefrontal network. In contrast, patients could only activate a subcortical
network that included the amygdala and hippocampus. This study provides evidence for
a disconnection in the transfer of information within frontostriatal networks in bipolar
disorder.
