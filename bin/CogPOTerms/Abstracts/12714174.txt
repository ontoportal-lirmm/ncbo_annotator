Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex refers to the ability of a weak prestimulus,
the prepulse, to inhibit the response to a closely following strong sensory stimulus,
the pulse. PPI is found to be deficient in a number of psychiatric and neurological
disorders associated with abnormalities at some level in the limbic and cortico-pallido-striato-thalamic
circuitry. We applied whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate
the neural correlates of PPI using airpuff stimuli as both the prepulse and the pulse
in groups of (i) healthy subjects and (ii) schizophrenic patients. Cerebral activation
during prepulse-plus-pulse stimuli with stimulus-onset asynchronies of 120 ms was
contrasted with activation during pulse-alone stimuli. In healthy subjects, PPI was
associated with increased activation bilaterally in the striatum extending to hippocampus
and thalamus, right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobe/supramarginal
gyrus, and with decreased activation in the right cerebellum and left medial occipital
lobe. All activated regions showed significantly greater response in healthy subjects
than schizophrenic patients, who also showed a trend for lower PPI. The findings demonstrate
involvement of the striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and frontal and parietal cortical
regions in PPI. Dysfunctions in any of these regions may underlie observations of
reduced PPI in schizophrenia.
