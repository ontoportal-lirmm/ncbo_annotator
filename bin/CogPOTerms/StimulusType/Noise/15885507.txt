Schizophrenia is characterised by marked disturbances of attention and information
processing. Patients experience difficulty focusing on relevant cues and avoiding
distraction by irrelevant stimuli. Event-related potential recordings indicate an
amplitude reduction in the P3a component elicited by involuntary orienting to task-irrelevant,
infrequent novel stimuli presented during auditory oddball detection in patients with
schizophrenia. The goal of the present study was to elucidate the functional abnormality
underlying the disturbed orienting to novel stimuli in schizophrenia. Twenty-eight
stable, partially remitted, medicated patients with schizophrenia and 28 healthy control
participants completed a novelty oddball variant during event-related fMRI. Relative
to healthy participants, patients with schizophrenia were characterised by underactivity
during novel stimulus processing in the right amygdala-hippocampus, within paralimbic
cortex in the rostral anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortices and the
right frontal operculum, and in association cortex at the right temporo-parietal-occipital
junction, bilateral intraparietal sulcus, and bilateral dorsal frontal cortex. Subcortically,
relative hypoactivation during novelty processing was apparent in the cerebellum,
thalamus, and basal ganglia. These results suggest that patients less efficiently
reorient processing resources away from the ongoing task of detecting and responding
to the task-relevant target stimuli. In addition, trend results suggest that patients
experienced increased distraction by novel stimuli.
