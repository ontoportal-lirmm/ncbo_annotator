Relationships between aberrant social functioning and depression have been explored
via behavioral, clinical, and survey methodologies, highlighting their importance
in the etiology of depression. The neural underpinnings of these relationships, however,
have not been explored.Nine depressed participants and 14 never-depressed control
subjects viewed emotional and neutral pictures at two functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) scanning sessions approximately 22 weeks apart. In the interim, depressed
patients received the antidepressant Venlafaxine. Positively rated images were parsed
into three separate comparisons: social interaction, human faces, and sexual images;
across scanning session, activation to these images was compared with other positively
rated images.For each of the three social stimulus types (social interaction, faces,
sexual images), a distinguishable circuitry was activated equally in non-depressed
control subjects and post-treatment depressed subjects but showed a hypo-response
in the depressed group pre-treatment. These structures include regions of prefrontal,
temporal, and parietal cortices, insula, basal ganglia, and the hippocampus.The neural
hypo-response to positively valenced social stimuli that is observed in depression
remits as response to antidepressant medication occurs, suggesting a state-dependent
deficiency in response to positive social incentives. These findings underscore the
importance of addressing social dysfunction in research and treatment of depression.
