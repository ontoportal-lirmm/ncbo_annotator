To examine whether euthymic bipolar patients engage similar or contrasting brain regions
as healthy subjects when responding to implicit affect induction.The study examined
10 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy
subjects using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects
engaged in a modified word-based memory task designed to implicitly evoke negative,
positive or no affective change. The activation paradigm involved nominating whether
a target word was contained within a previously presented word list using specified
response keys.The fMRI task produced significantly greater activation in healthy subjects
as compared to patients in response to both negative and positive affect in the anterior
and posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, middle frontal and right parahippocampal
gyri. Only negative affect produced significantly greater activation in the postcentral
gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, thalamus and putamen and only positive affect achieved
the same in the precentral, superior temporal and lingual gyri, precuneus, cuneus,
caudate, pons, midbrain and cerebellum. There were no brain regions in which responses
were greater in patients as compared to healthy subjects. There were no statistically
significant differences between the groups with respect to speed or accuracy.Diminished
prefrontal, cingulate, limbic and subcortical neural activity in euthymic bipolar
patients as compared to healthy subjects is suggestive of emotional compromise that
is independent of cognitive and executive functioning. This finding is of clinical
importance and has implications both for the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.
Future studies should aim to replicate these findings and examine the development
of bipolar disorder, investigating in particular the effects of medication.
