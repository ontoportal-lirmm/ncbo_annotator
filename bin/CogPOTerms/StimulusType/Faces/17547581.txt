To determine the neural responses invoked in the recognition of facial fear and disgust
in euthymic bipolar patients as compared with healthy subjects.This study examined
10 female euthymic bipolar patients, and 10 suitably matched healthy subjects using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects were engaged in an explicit
facial emotion recognition task involving fear, disgust and neutral expressions. The
activation paradigm involved nominating the facial expression using specified response
keys. Behavioural data were collected and analysed and both within-group (Fear versus
Neutral; Disgust versus Neutral) and random-effects between-group analyses were performed
on fMRI data using BrainVoyager (Brain Innovations, Maastricht, the Netherlands).Patients
were equally accurate in identifying facial expressions as healthy subjects but were
slower to respond, especially with respect to fear and disgust. Responses to fear
and disgust (within-group analyses) resulted in activation of anticipated brain regions
such as amygdala and insula, respectively. However, between-group random effects analysis
revealed differential responses to both disgust and fear in both healthy subjects
and euthymic bipolar patients such that euthymic bipolar patients responded largely
to fear and healthy subjects responded more so to disgust. This partitioning of responsiveness
was reflected by differential activation involving the hippocampus and amygdala.Greater
responsiveness to fear with hippocampal activation in patients perhaps reflects recollection
of traumatic events associated with past experiences of illness or simply the use
of a more mnemonic (hippocampal) as opposed to affective (amygdala) approach when
performing the task. It is possible that in bipolar disorder, prefrontal-subcortical
network dysfunction that relegates neural processing to limbic regions is impaired
and that clinically euthymic bipolar patients, although able to accurately and effectively
identify emotions such as fear and disgust, are limited in their ability to interpret
their salience. The implications of these findings are discussed.
