Patients with schizophrenia improve episodic memory accuracy when given organizational
strategies through levels-of-processing paradigms. This study tested if improvement
is accompanied by normalized frontotemporal function.Event-related blood-oxygen-level-dependent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure activation during
shallow (perceptual) and deep (semantic) word encoding and recognition in 14 patients
with schizophrenia and 14 healthy comparison subjects.Despite slower and less accurate
overall word classification, the patients showed normal levels-of-processing effects,
with faster and more accurate recognition of deeply processed words. These effects
were accompanied by left ventrolateral prefrontal activation during encoding in both
groups, although the thalamus, hippocampus, and lingual gyrus were overactivated in
the patients. During word recognition, the patients showed overactivation in the left
frontal pole and had a less robust right prefrontal response.Evidence of normal levels-of-processing
effects and left prefrontal activation suggests that patients with schizophrenia can
form and maintain semantic representations when they are provided with organizational
cues and can improve their word encoding and retrieval. Areas of overactivation suggest
residual inefficiencies. Nevertheless, the effect of teaching organizational strategies
on episodic memory and brain function is a worthwhile topic for future interventional
studies.
