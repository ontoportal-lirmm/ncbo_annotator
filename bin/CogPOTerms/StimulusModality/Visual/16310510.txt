Patients with bipolar disorder have been reported to have abnormal cortical function
during mania. In this study, we sought to investigate neural activity in the frontal
lobe during mania, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Specifically,
we sought to evaluate activation in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region
that is normally activated during activities that require response inhibition.Eleven
manic subjects and 13 control subjects underwent fMRI while performing the Go-NoGo
task, a neuropsychological paradigm known to activate the orbitofrontal cortex in
normal subjects. Patterns of whole-brain activation during fMRI scanning were determined
with statistical parametric mapping. Contrasts were made for each subject for the
NoGo minus Go conditions. Contrasts were used in a second-level analysis with subject
as a random factor.Functional MRI data revealed robust activation of the right orbitofrontal
cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 47) in control subjects but not in manic subjects. Random-effects
analyses demonstrated significantly less magnitude in signal intensity in the right
lateral orbitofrontal cortex (BA 47), right hippocampus, and left cingulate (BA 24)
in manic compared with control subjects.Mania is associated with a significant attenuation
of task-related activation of right lateral orbitofrontal function. This lack of activation
of a brain region that is usually involved in suppression of responses might account
for some of the disinhibition seen in mania. In addition, hippocampal and cingulate
activation seem to be decreased. The relationship between this reduced function and
the symptoms of mania remain to be further explored.
