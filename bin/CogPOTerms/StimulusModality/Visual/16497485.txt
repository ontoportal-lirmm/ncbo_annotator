Successful and unsuccessful intention to learn words was assessed by means of event-related
functional MRI. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy control participants
were scanned while being given two word lists to read and another seven to learn with
immediate recall. Neural activation patterns were segregated according to whether
words were subsequently recalled or forgotten and these conditions were contrasted
with each other and reading. Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia showed
deficits with regard to neural recruitment of right hippocampus and of cerebellar
structures during successful verbal learning. Furthermore, a reversal of activated
structures was evident in the two groups: Controls showed activation of right frontal
and left middle temporal structures during the unsuccessful intention to learn. During
successful learning, there was additional activation of right superior parietal lobule.
In contrast, patients showed activation of right superior parietal lobule during unsuccessful
and successful intention to learn. There were additional frontal and left middle temporal
lobe activations during successful learning. We conclude that increased parietal activity
may reflect a mechanism which compensates for the lack of hippocampal and cerebellar
contributions to verbal learning in schizophrenia.
